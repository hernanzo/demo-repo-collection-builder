# About The Project 
This project examines the intersection of racial ideologies, modern sports, and Black mobility by exploring the trajectories of several Afro-descended boxers and wrestlers who moved to Chile to launch careers in the nascent combat sports industry between 1900 and 1930. By analyzing the complex and diverse experiences of these individuals in and out of the ring, I aim to understand how the Sporting Black Diaspora—a concept developed by British sociologist Ben Carrington—overlapped with the parallel consolidation of modern sports in the Southern Cone, both as a racial project and as a hyper-commercialized mass cultural product.

By examining discourses surrounding their involvement in Chilean boxing, as well as the material conditions they faced—the contingency, violence, and institutionalized racism they endured—I explore how these athletes were racialized through notions of biological difference and positioned within a global hierarchy of mass cultural products. This project highlights sports as an active site for shaping and reshaping racial discourses during a critical period of global imperial disintegration and Chile’s nation-state reformulation. Despite its peripheral position in global mass culture, Chile emerged as another locus of contestation over the meanings of the “Black Athlete.” Afro-descended boxers, originating from the U.S., the Circum-Caribbean region, and the Black Pacific, actively participated in redefining negritude by reshaping the contours and significance of Black athleticism. They challenged the racial parameters imposed by Chile’s sporting intelligentsia on all boxeadores negros by contesting the components of the trope of the Black Athlete. When depicted as savage brawlers, these boxers countered by showcasing their expertise in modern physical training and “scientific” boxing. When denigrated as mere merchandise, they asserted their agency as cultural producers, venturing into sports promotion and modernizing commercial practices. When characterized as perpetually mobile individuals, they established permanent roots in Chile, becoming key figures in the local boxing circuit.
