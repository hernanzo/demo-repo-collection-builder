description: "This project examines the intersection of racial ideologies, modern sports, and Black mobility by exploring the trajectories of several Afro-descended boxers and wrestlers who moved to Chile to launch careers in the nascent combat sports industry between 1900 and 1930. By analyzing the complex and diverse experiences of these individuals in and out of the ring, I aim to understand how the Sporting Black Diaspora—a concept developed by British sociologist Ben Carrington—overlapped with the parallel consolidation of modern sports in the Southern Cone, both as a racial project and as a hyper-commercialized mass cultural product."
